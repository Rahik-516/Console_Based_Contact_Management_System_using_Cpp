# Console_Based_Contact_Management_System_using_Cpp

We propose to develop a "Contact Management System" as a mini-project using C++ programming. The 
aim of this project is to create a console-based application that allows users to efficiently manage their 
contact information. This system will enable users to add, view, edit, search, and delete contacts. All 
contact records will be stored in a file, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

The Contact Management System will include the following key features:
1. Add Contacts: Users will be able to add new contacts with details such as first name, last name, 
phone number, and address.
2. List Contacts: The system will provide an option to display a list of all contacts, showing their names 
and corresponding contact details.
3. Search Contacts: Users can search for specific contacts by phone number.
4. Edit Contacts: The system will allow users to edit contact information, including first name, last name, 
phone number, and address.
5. Delete Contacts: Users will have the ability to delete unwanted contacts from the system.
